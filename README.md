This repository contains my progress and solutions for the "30 Days of Vanilla JavaScript" challenge by Wes Bos. In this challenge, I aim to improve my JavaScript skills by building 30 different projects using only vanilla JavaScript(no libraries or frameworks). <br>

I enrolled in this course to deepen my understanding and become familiar with working in JavaScript. My goal is to build interactive and functional websites, and I believe that JavaScript30 will provide me with the necessary knowledge and skills to achieve that. By completing the course's projects and gaining hands-on experience, I aim to enhance my proficiency in JavaScript programming, enabling me to create dynamic web pages and applications.
